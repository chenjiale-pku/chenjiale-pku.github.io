In a randomized exam, each student is asked a small number of random questions from a large question bank. The fair grading problem is to estimate the average grade of each student on the full question bank.  The maximum-likelihood estimator for the Bradley-Terry-Luce model on the bipartite student-question graph is shown to be consistent when the number of questions asked to each student is at least the cubed-logarithm of the number of students. In an empirical study on exam data and in simulations, our algorithm based on the maximum-likelihood estimator significantly outperforms simple averaging, i.e., calculating grades by averaging scores on the questions each student is asked, even with a small class and exam size.","tags":[],"title":"Fair Grading Algorithms for Randomized Exams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiale Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1657036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657036800,"objectID":"70377b70264ee41a31b8c974fed42697","permalink":"https://chenjiale-pku.github.io/publication/locallyfaircakecutting.html","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/locallyfaircakecutting.html","section":"publication","summary":"We studied the local fairness of the cake-cutting problem.

However, the collected statistics are not sufficient to reflect how informative the feedback is since fully informative feedback (equal affection of the choices) and fully uninformative feedback (random selection) have the same uniform statistics.\nHere we distinguish the above two scenarios by additionally asking for respondents' predictions about others' choices. We assume that informative respondents' predictions strongly depend on their own choices while uninformative respondents' do not. With this assumption, we propose a new definition for uninformative feedback and correspondingly design a family of evaluation metrics, called f-variety, for group-level feedback which can 1) distinguish informative feedback and uninformative feedback (separation) even if their statistics are both uniform and 2) decrease as the ratio of uninformative respondents increases (monotonicity). We validate our approach both theoretically and numerically. Moreover, we conduct two real-world case studies about 1) comparisons about athletes and 2) comparisons about stand-up comedians to show the superiority of our approach.","tags":[],"title":"Equal Affection or Random Selection: the Quality of Subjective Feedback from a Group Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaicheng Yang","Jianyu Wu","Pu Yi","Jiale Chen","Cheng Chen","Tong Yang","Bin Cui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590940800,"objectID":"b1c6d622f0b41599ee13441f9b4fca00","permalink":"https://chenjiale-pku.github.io/publication/hoppingtimer.html","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hoppingtimer.html","section":"publication","summary":"In high-speed data streams, recent items are often much more significant than outdated ones. Therefore, basic estimation of data streams in hopping windows is an important topic. Basic estimation tasks include cardinality estimation and membership query. There are three classic algorithms for basic tasks in fixed windows. The design goal of this paper is to devise a generic and near-optimal framework to adapt them to hopping windows. In this paper, we propose the HoppingTimer, a generic and near-optimal framework which can adapt fixed-window algorithms to time-based and count-based hopping windows for basic tasks. The key idea of HoppingTimer is to use hopping timestamps and local cleaning to clean outdated items. We apply HoppingTimer to three algorithms for basic tasks. Experimental results show that HoppingTimer is near-optimal in hopping windows, and achieves false positive rate about 1000 times lower than the state-of-the-art when using metrics of sliding-window model. All source codes are open-sourced and released at Github.","tags":[],"title":"HoppingTimer: A Near-optimal Framework for Basic Estimation of Data Streams in Hopping Windows","type":"publication"}]
