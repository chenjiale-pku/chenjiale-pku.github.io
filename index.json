We also obtain the same update time for maintaining a fractional approximate weighted matching (and hence an approximation to the value of the maximum weight matching) and an integral approximate weighted matching in dense graphs. Our unweighted result improves upon the prior state-of-the-art which includes a poly(log n)⋅2^O(ε^{-2}) update time [Assadi-Bernstein-Dudeja 2022] and an O(√m ε^{−2}) update time [Gupta-Peng 2013], and our weighted result improves upon the O(√m ε^{−O(1/ε)} log n) update time due to [Gupta-Peng 2013]. To obtain our results, we generalize a recent optimization approach to dynamic algorithms from [Jambulapati-Jin-Sidford-Tian 2022]. We show that repeatedly solving entropy-regularized optimization problems yields a lazy updating scheme for fractional decremental problems with a near-optimal number of updates. To apply this framework we develop optimization methods compatible with it and new dynamic rounding algorithms for the matching polytope.","tags":[],"title":"Entropy Regularization and Faster Decremental Matching in General Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiale Chen","Jason Hartline and Onno Zoeter"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1683402141,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683402141,"objectID":"e9fd86b3c4e91aa772b888b7b1dfd587","permalink":"https://chenjiale-pku.github.io/publication/fairgrading/","publishdate":"2023-05-06T12:42:21-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fairgrading/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies grading algorithms for randomized exams. In a randomized exam, each student is asked a small number of random questions from a large question bank. The predominant grading rule is simple averaging, i.e., calculating grades by averaging scores on the questions each student is asked, which is fair ex-ante, over the randomized questions, but not fair ex-post, on the realized questions. The fair grading problem is to estimate the average grade of each student on the full question bank. The maximum-likelihood estimator for the Bradley-Terry-Luce model on the bipartite student-question graph is shown to be consistent with high probability when the number of questions asked to each student is at least the cubed-logarithm of the number of students. In an empirical study on exam data and in simulations, our algorithm based on the maximum-likelihood estimator significantly outperforms simple averaging in prediction accuracy and ex-post fairness even with a small class and exam size.","tags":[],"title":"Fair Grading Algorithms for Randomized Exams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiale Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1657036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657036800,"objectID":"70377b70264ee41a31b8c974fed42697","permalink":"https://chenjiale-pku.github.io/publication/locallyfaircakecutting/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/locallyfaircakecutting/","section":"publication","summary":"We studied the local fairness of the cake-cutting problem.

However, the collected statistics are not sufficient to reflect how informative the feedback is since fully informative feedback (equal affection of the choices) and fully uninformative feedback (random selection) have the same uniform statistics.\nHere we distinguish the above two scenarios by additionally asking for respondents' predictions about others' choices. We assume that informative respondents' predictions strongly depend on their own choices while uninformative respondents' do not. With this assumption, we propose a new definition for uninformative feedback and correspondingly design a family of evaluation metrics, called f-variety, for group-level feedback which can 1) distinguish informative feedback and uninformative feedback (separation) even if their statistics are both uniform and 2) decrease as the ratio of uninformative respondents increases (monotonicity). We validate our approach both theoretically and numerically. Moreover, we conduct two real-world case studies about 1) comparisons about athletes and 2) comparisons about stand-up comedians to show the superiority of our approach.","tags":[],"title":"Equal Affection or Random Selection: the Quality of Subjective Feedback from a Group Perspective","type":"publication"}]
