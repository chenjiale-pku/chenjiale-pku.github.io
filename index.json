However, the collected statistics are not sufficient to reflect how informative the feedback is since fully informative feedback (equal affection of the choices) and fully uninformative feedback (random selection) have the same uniform statistics.\nHere we distinguish the above two scenarios by additionally asking for respondents' predictions about others' choices. We assume that informative respondents' predictions strongly depend on their own choices while uninformative respondents' do not. With this assumption, we propose a new definition for uninformative feedback and correspondingly design a family of evaluation metrics, called f-variety, for group-level feedback which can 1) distinguish informative feedback and uninformative feedback (separation) even if their statistics are both uniform and 2) decrease as the ratio of uninformative respondents increases (monotonicity). We validate our approach both theoretically and numerically. Moreover, we conduct two real-world case studies about 1) comparisons about athletes and 2) comparisons about stand-up comedians to show the superiority of our approach.","tags":[],"title":"Equal Affection or Random Selection: the Quality of Subjective Feedback from a Group Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheng Zhong$^{\\star}$","Jiale Chen$^{\\star}$","Shiqi Jiang","Yutong Hu","Tong Yang","Bin Cui","Uhlig Steve"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612108800,"objectID":"8bb0591ed8cf709d63227132ebd2b90f","permalink":"https://chenjiale-pku.github.io/publication/microscopesketch.html","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/microscopesketch.html","section":"publication","summary":"Approximate estimation of data streams provides real-time information for various applications. Estimation based on a sliding window has attracted much interest recently. The state-of-the-art approaches cannot achieve high accuracy, generality in algorithms and models, with limited memory usage, all at once. We propose MicroscopeSketch and its key technique, adaptive zooming. The key idea of adaptive zooming is to automatically zoom in or zoom out, to get a better view of the window.We theoretically analyze the error bound, the unilateral error, and the unbiased rounding error of MicroscopeSketch. We apply MicroscopeSketch to three tasks: frequency estimation, finding top-ùëò frequent items, and finding top-ùëò heavy changes. Compared to existing works, our experimental results show that the error of MicroscopeSketch is 363 times smaller in estimating the frequency and 15.2 smaller in finding top-ùëò items than the existing works.

Therefore, basic estimation of data streams in hopping windows is an important topic. Basic estimation tasks include cardinality estimation and membership query. There are three classic algorithms for basic tasks in fixed windows. The design goal of this paper is to devise a generic and near-optimal framework to adapt them to hopping windows. In this paper, we propose the HoppingTimer, a generic and near-optimal framework which can adapt fixed-window algorithms to time-based and count-based hopping windows for basic tasks. The key idea of HoppingTimer is to use hopping timestamps and local cleaning to clean outdated items. We apply HoppingTimer to three algorithms for basic tasks. Experimental results show that HoppingTimer is near-optimal in hopping windows, and achieves false positive rate about 1000 times lower than the state-of-the-art when using metrics of sliding-window model. All source codes are open-sourced and released at Github.","tags":[],"title":"HoppingTimer: A Near-optimal Framework for Basic Estimation of Data Streams in Hopping Windows","type":"publication"}]
